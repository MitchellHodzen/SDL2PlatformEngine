# SDL2PlatformEngine
A simple platformer (game) engine. This project was a way for me to learn C++ and SDL2.
Note: All files are currently in one folder. This is because folders made in visual studio are "virtual folders", that is they don't physically exist. In the visual studio IDE these files appear organized in folders, but in the file explorer (and github) they appear disorganized. I plan on turning these folders into physical folders at a later date.
